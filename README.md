# Swarm-Robots-2.0
We tried two developed a network of 4 Robots to form a particular pattern formed on an Android App.
4 Swarm Robots each of different color on the top were made. Each bot had a black strip dividing the top of the robot into two unequal areas. This was done to identify the direction of the robot.
An android application was used to draw any pattern. The pattern was then divided into 4 equidistant points (So the 4 robots can be placed).
We used an overhead camera for identifying the coordinates of the robot on a black background. The camera gave feedback to a laptop which then decided the direction of movement of the robot to place it at a specified position.
